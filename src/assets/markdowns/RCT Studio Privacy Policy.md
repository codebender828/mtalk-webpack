- anyone expressly authorized by you to receive your personal information; and
- anyone to whom we are required by law to disclose personal information, upon valid and enforceable request thereof.



We may disclose your blockchain wallet address (if applicable) to third-party NFT trading platforms, to allow the third parties to assist us to determine whether such blockchain wallet address belongs to you, so that we could provide the subsequent services related to NFT products to you, and to protect our users’ benefit.

No transmission of data over the internet can be 100% secure.



#### **5.**   **COOKIES AND GOOGLE ANALYTICS**

##### **5.1.** **Cookies.**

We may from time to time implement “cookies” or other features to allow us or third parties to collect or share information that will help us improve our website and the Services we offer, or help us offer new services and features. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your computer or device and tell us how and when the Services or website are used or visited, by how many people and to track movements within our website. Cookies also link to information regarding what items you have clicked or pages you have viewed. Cookies are also used to deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website usage. If you are uncomfortable with cookies, you can accept or decline cookies at any time by modifying your browser settings. Most browsers are set to accept cookies automatically. You can set your browser to decline all cookies automatically or to prompt you for a response each time a cookie is offered.

We use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them). To make it easier for you to understand why we need them, the Cookies we use on our Site and Services can be grouped into the following categories:

- **Strictly Necessary**: These Cookies are necessary for the Site and Services to work properly.
- **Functionality:** These Cookies enable technical performance and allow us to “remember” the choices you make while browsing our Site, including any preferences you set.
- **Performance/Analytical**: These Cookies allow us to collect certain information about how you navigate the Site or use the Services running on your device. They help us understand which areas you use and what we can do to improve them.
- **Targeting:** These Cookies are used to deliver relevant information related to our Services to an identified machine or other device (not a named or otherwise identifiable person) which has previously been used to visit our Site. Some of these types of Cookies on our Site are operated by third parties with our permission and are used to identify advertising sources that are effectively driving customers to our Site.



##### **5.2.** **Pixels**

(aka web beacons/web bugs/java script). Pixels are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are used to track the online movements of web users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixels are small graphics that are about the size of the period at the end of the sentence that are embedded invisibly on web pages or in HTML-based emails. We may use other technologies such as web beacons to help deliver cookies on our websites and count users who have visited our websites. Our third-party analytics provider may place pixels on our Services that track what other websites you visit (both before and after visiting our websites).



##### **5.3.** **Google Analytics.**

Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyse how users use the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. For more information regarding Google’s use of cookies, collection and use of information, see the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US) . If you would like to opt out of Google Analytics tracking, please visit the following link: [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).



#### **6.**   **HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION**

Keeping secure personal information that we collect is of great concern to us. We take appropriate technical, physical and administrative measures to handle collected information in a secure manner which is consistent with the applicable laws. Depending on the circumstances, we may hold your information in hard copy and/or electronic form. For each medium, we use technologies and procedures to protect personal information. We review our strategies and update as necessary to meet our business needs, changes in technology, and regulatory requirements. These measures include, but are not limited to, technical and organizational security policies and procedures, security controls and employee training.



If we become aware of any breach that affects the security of your personal information, we will provide you with notice as required by applicable laws. By using the Services, you agree to accept notice electronically. While we have mechanisms in place to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. When you provide information to the Services, you do so at your own risk.



#### **7.**   **CHILDREN**

REMOVAL OF YOUR CONTENT OR INFORMATION FROM THE SERVICES DOES NOT ENSURE COMPLETE OR COMPREHENSIVE REMOVAL OF THAT CONTENT OR INFORMATION FROM OUR SYSTEMS OR THE SYSTEMS OF OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS. We are not required to delete the Content or information posted by you; our obligations under California law are satisfied so long as we anonymize the Content or information or render it invisible to other users and the public.
